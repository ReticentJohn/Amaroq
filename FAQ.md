# FAQ

### Where's the code? I thought you were going to open source Amaroq?
It's here. You're welcome. :3

### What is Amaroq written in?
Amaroq is written entirely in Obj-C. Not apposed to mixing Swift in there if need be, but I like being verbose.

### Can I beta test Amaroq?
Yes! If a beta is currently available I will gladly allow anyone to beta test for as long as I have open slots available. Email your Apple ID to amaroq.feedback@gmail.com and I will send invites out when a build is about to be pushed.

### Where is the best place to contact you?
In the following order you will get the fastest response, but I try to stay on top of things and respond to everyone:
1. By mentioning me [@eurasierboy@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@eurasierboy)
2. Tagging #Amaroq in a public post that will federate to mastodon.social
3. Creating an issue here, if it regards feedback or bug reports
4. Emailing amaroq.feedback@gmail.com
5. Awooing into the void
6. Messenger owl

### Where is the return key in the toot composer?
Amaroq uses the twitter-style keyboard (yes Apple created a specific system keyboard for twitter). Press the '123' key to get access to the return key.

### Will Amaroq ever support iPad?
Yes, but not for a long time. Please don't hold your breath!

### x, y, z feature doesn't work on my instance. Is this a bug with Amaroq?
Maybe! Doesn't hurt to ask. But please consider comparing behaviors with other instances first. If something is happening on your instance that isn't happening on another, it's likely an issue with your instance. I am a very busy doggo and don't have time to debug everyone's instances - my first replies will usually request that you make sure your admin is using the stable latest release of Mastodon, as the platform is rapidly evolving.

### Push notifications aren't working for me, what's wrong?
Sometimes Amaroq's notification servers belch, and miss a registration or two. Don't panic! Just force-quit your app and restart it. This should re-register you. If notifications continue to not work, make sure you have background refreshing enabled, as the notifications are actually created locally in the background. If you then *still* have issues, I'm afraid there's something wrong with your instance's ability to open websocket connections. Contact your admin and have them make sure their stream API is functional.

### Does Amaroq's notification server see any of the content that it pushes for notifications?
No. Amaroq's push notifications are actually silent, and they don't contain anything other than a message telling the app that content is available. The notification you see is created locally in the background based on that silent notification.

### Where's the multi-instance support?
Soon™

### Where's the translation support?
Maybe Someday™ It can get really expensive. I suggest finding other methods of doing this, like copy+paste into your translator of choice. There are some excellent guides out there to make this even easier too!

### Will Amaroq ever be localized for xyz language?
Sure! If you're fluent I can provide localization files. Email amaroq.feedback@gmail.com with your offer of assistance.

### Do you have a Patreon?
Nope. Probably won't, unless things start getting out of hand financially. For now, I have a tip jar on my bio.

### Will Amaroq ever support 3D-Touch?
Yes! But not until all devices have adequate functionality first.

### Where's the share extension?
Soon™

### Where's the username autocompletion?
Soon™

### Will Amaroq ever have an in-app browser?
I will be eventually providing an option to open an in-app browser. Just keep in mind that Amaroq will always abide ATS rules, so https only.

### My server has no SSL cert and won't connect to Amaroq. Can you allow it?
Amaroq will always abide ATS rules, so https only I'm afraid.

### What is Awoo Mode?
Don't awoo.
